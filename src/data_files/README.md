The following path is used by the LOVD API to write files to that are to be
imported automatically. Other processes can also store files there that are
to be imported. This setting is optional.
For LOVD+, this path is where your data files need to be located.
If filled in, make sure the directory is readable and writable for the user
running the webserver.
Preferably, use a directory outside of the document root, or otherwise block
the directory from being read directly by the webserver.
